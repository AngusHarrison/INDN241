 Egmont Arens was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1889. An industrial designer and publisher. He was a leading designer and pioneer in the fields of packaging and plastics.
 Egmont is credited with introducing “appetite appeal” in packaging design. The design lanuage of eye-catching colors, primarily red and yellow, and placeing an image of the product on the packiging.
 Egmont began his own design company in 1935 and began wprking with a range of high profile clients including General Electric, Fairchild Aircraft, Anheuser-Busch, The Coca-Cola Company, Colombian Rope Company, Waterman Pens, Colgate-Palmolive and ofcurse KitchenAid.


During the majority of his production after the 1930's the popular design movement of the time was Streamline Moderne. This is a style of Art deco design the is inspired by aerodynamic design that had boomed due to the world wars.
Streamline design lended itself to kitchen applinces as the rounded surfaces of the mixers are central to design. With form following function the functionality of the rounded edges eliminated crevices where food might get stuck and facilitating cleaning.  

Streamline Morderne emphasis curving forms and long horizontal lines.
Streamline Morderne is a minamilist style that as with aerodynamics removes unnessacry components that "would cause drag" creating a sleek modern design that still stands to this day.

In the late 1930's Egmont Arens sent a telegram to President Roosevelt: "Streamlining has captured American imagination to mean modern, efficient, well-organized, sweet clean and beautiful...'"

In 1942 Egmont Arens also co designed another piece of kitchen wear with the same design lanuage as the KitchenAid. The "Streamliner" meat slicer had a similar curvatious form this time built from  aluminum. It consisted of a spinning stainless steel blade with two sharping stones Sandwiching a section of the blade. Meaning that as it spun it would sparpen itself. The Streamliner meat slicer was a sucess selling more that 100,000 units.



* Design Intent
  To redesign the aesthric of funtional products using his own design launage and the zeitgeist of the time at the request of the product manufactures

* Inspiration
  The Streamline Moderne zeitgeist

* materials
  Zink body with stainless steel and plastic trim
* production process
  KitchenAid's are cast in a foundry before being shipped to Ohio to be assembled and tested predomintly by hand.

* Zeitgeist
  Streamline Moderne arouse after the great depression in the 1930's. the style can be contrasted with functionalism which focued on reducing the production costs of maunfacturing such gooods.


- Who designed it? And when was it designed?
  Egmont Arens, 1937.

- What was the motivation? Was it designed to solve a problem? If so, what was the problem? And was the
design deemed a good solution at the time? Is the approach still valid?


- How the designer came up with the idea? How long did it take to complete the design since its inception?


- Why was it formed that way? Did the designer consider any different shapes, structures or configurations?
Has the original form been modified? If so, what was the reason?


- How was it crafted, manufactured or built? Was the method or process believed innovative then? Is it still
the same from today’s perspective?


- Who was the target audience? How did the audience or critics react to the design at first? Has it changed
over time?


- Is the design still in production or use? If so, is the fact noteworthy compared with the competition or
similar attempts that have since been made?


- How can the short-term and long-term impact of the design classic, including associated factors, such as
introduction of a pioneering process or subsequent changes it has prompted, if any, on our lifestyle, other
designers, relevant industries, and the environment be described?

- What was planned and practised by the designer ahead of the times?


- What was not fully considered or even missing at the time? Has there been any improvement made?


- How different today’s perceptions, knowledge and values are from those of the times? And how likely
would they change in the future?


- Do we have access to better materials, processes and technologies now?


- What do you want to say to the designer if you had a chance?
