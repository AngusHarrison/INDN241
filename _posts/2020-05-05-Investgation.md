Egmont Arens was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1889. An industrial designer and publisher. He was a leading designer and pioneer in the fields of packaging and plastics.  
Egmont is credited with introducing “appetite appeal” in packaging design. The design language of eye-catching colours, primarily red and yellow, and placing an image of the product on the packaging.  
Egmont began his own design company in 1935 and began working with a range of high profile clients including General Electric, Fairchild Aircraft, Anheuser-Busch, The Coca-Cola Company, Colombian Rope Company, Waterman Pens, Colgate-Palmolive and of course KitchenAid.  

During the majority of his production after the 1930's the popular design movement of the time was Streamline Moderne. This is a style of Art deco design the is inspired by aerodynamic design that had boomed due to the world wars.  
Streamline design lends itself to kitchen appliances as the rounded surfaces of the mixers are central to design. With form following function the functionality of the rounded edges eliminated crevices where food might get stuck and facilitating cleaning.    

Streamline Morderne emphasis curving forms and long horizontal lines.
Streamline Morderne is a minimalist style that as with aerodynamics removes unnecessary components that "would cause drag" creating a sleek modern design that still stands to this day.  

In the late 1930's Egmont Arens sent a telegram to President Roosevelt: "Streamlining has captured American imagination to mean modern, efficient, well-organized, sweet clean and beautiful...'"   

In 1942 Egmont Arens also co designed another piece of kitchen wear with the same design language as the KitchenAid. The "Streamliner" meat slicer had a similar curvaceous form this time built from aluminium. It consisted of a spinning stainless-steel blade with two sharping stones Sandwiching a section of the blade. Meaning that as it spun it would sharpen itself. The Streamliner meat slicer was a success selling more than 100,000 units.  



* Design Intent    
 To redesign the aesthetic of functional products using his own design language and the zeitgeist of the time at the request of the product manufactures

* Inspiration    
 The Streamline Moderne zeitgeist

* Materials      
 Zink body with stainless steel and plastic trim
* Production process    
 KitchenAid's are cast in a foundry before being shipped to Ohio to be assembled and tested predominantly by hand.

* Zeitgeist    
 Streamline Moderne arouse after the great depression in the 1930's. the style can be contrasted with functionalism which focused on reducing the production costs of manufacturing such goods.
