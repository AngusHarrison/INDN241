##### KitchenAid Model K Mixer

KitchenAid is an American home appliance brand owned by Whirlpool Corporation started in 1919.
The Company had moderate success with the first Stand Mixer the Model H. Designed by Herbert Johnson. The product was innovative at the time as it automated the process of a baker mixing dough, but the form was purely functional. Over the next 10 years the market began to saturate, KitchenAid struggled to hold an edge in the market until the 1930's when Industrial Designer Egmont Arens introduced the classic silhouette of the Model K. The model K silhouette has changed little since the 1930's yet is still a very desirable and fashionable home appliance. Leading it to be selected as my design classic.

##### Model K Analysis   

Dieter Rams criteria for Good Design.    
* Is innovative: The initial invention of the mixer was very innovative as it automated the processes of mixing and kneading baking goods. At the time a great technological innovation, making the most of the current technology such as powerful electric motors.   

* Makes a product useful: The redesign by Egmont Arens maintained the functionality of the mixer
but greatly improved the aesthetic and visual language of the product. The improved aesthetic does not detract from the functionality of the mixer.   

* Is aesthetic: The unique design aesthetic imparted by Egmont was greatly different from the original mixer and separated the mixer from all other products on the market. While maintaining the form of a classic bench top mixer. The stainless-steel bowl and mixer blade cantered at the front of the product clearly conveys its function.

* Makes a product understandable: The Design is minimal with no unnecessary buttons or edges. Simply a speed switch and a latch to lock the head into place. The minimal form conveys the operation of this product easily.   

* Is unobtrusive: The mixer is semi unobtrusive depending on the colour palette. The rounded edges and minimal design help to blend it into the kitchen atmosphere. Egmont showed restraint in the design keeping the mixer quite neutral. Prioritizing the function.    

* Is honest: This product is very honest as its function is simple and it delivers on the consumers promise of being a powerful and reliable Mixer.   

* Is long-lasting: The design is fashionable yet timeless as the form has not changed over the last 90 years.   

* Is thorough down to the last detail: The minimalist design means that all components and forms are well thought out.   

* Is environmentally friendly: This product is semi sustainable due to its longevity and use of metals. However, I believe a more sustainable product can be designed.   

* Involves as little design as possible: As form follows function this product involves little design something my interpretation will aim to follow.
