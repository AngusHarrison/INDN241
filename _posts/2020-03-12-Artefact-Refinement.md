**According to Dieter Rams, good design:**

* Is innovative
* Makes a product useful
* Is aesthetic
* Makes a product understandable
* Is unobtrusive
* Is honest
* Is long-lasting
* Is thorough down to the last detail
* Is environmentally friendly
* Involves as little design as possible

## Process Step 2
 Compare the artefacts and narrow them down to a few that you think of as examples of good
design. Start your exploratory analysis by trying to find answers to these questions (where
applicable) for each of the artefacts selected:

* Who designed it?
* When was it designed?
* What did the designer want to express/deliver?
* Was it the designerâ€™s answer or resolution to a problem or issue?
* How long did it take to complete the design since its inception?
* What is the material(s) it is made of/from?
* How was it manufactured/crafted?
* Were there any design/technical challenges? How did the designer overcome them?
* How many units have been produced?
* Was the material(s) and/or manufacturing/crafting process better than its predecessors or
competition? If so, how and why?
* Was there any consideration of its potential impact on the environment, people or society
put into practice ahead of its time?
* Who was its target audience? What kind of responses did it meet with?
* Can you describe its typical use or experience?
* What are the most impressive qualities or features of the design (in your opinion)?
* Did you find any less known but remarkably enticing features?
* Any other intriguing facts?
* Do you think it is technically, aesthetically or culturally important or meaningful?
* In conclusion, why do you think it deserves to be an exemplar of good design?
* How would you improve it if you redesign it?
