**According to Dieter Rams, good design:**

* Is innovative
* Makes a product useful
* Is aesthetic
* Makes a product understandable
* Is unobtrusive
* Is honest
* Is long-lasting
* Is thorough down to the last detail
* Is environmentally friendly
* Involves as little design as possible

## Process Step 2
 Compare the artefacts and narrow them down to a few that you think of as examples of good
design. Start your exploratory analysis by trying to find answers to these questions (where
applicable) for each of the artefacts selected:


#### 2 preferred artefacts
* Dyson cyclone vacuum
* Maglite


#### Dyson Cyclone Vacuum
* Who designed it?
  - James Dyson
* When was it designed?
  - 1978 to 1993
* What did the designer want to express/deliver?
  - A powerful bagless vacuum that didn't loose suction
* Was it the designerâ€™s answer or resolution to a problem or issue?  
  - Bag less vacuums at the time lost suction as soon as they became partially full.
* How long did it take to complete the design since its inception?
  - 15 years, Over 5000 prototypes made
* What is the material(s) it is made of/from?  
  - Plastic, Rubber, Metal
* How was it manufactured/crafted?
  - manufactured in an industrial production line in Malaysia
* Were there any design/technical challenges? How did the designer overcome them?
  - Creating a bag less vacuum that could complete in a market dominated by bagged vacuums at the time was a huge challenge, and took Mr. Dyson 15 years to achieve.
* How many units have been produced?
  - More than 100 million
* Was the material(s) and/or manufacturing/crafting process better than its predecessors or competition? If so, how and why?
  - Creating a competitive bag less vacuum at the time was a huge advantage for the company as it meant their product was more environmentally friendly and reduced the operational cost of owning a vacuum even if the initial cost was greater.

* Was there any consideration of its potential impact on the environment, people or society put into practice ahead of its time?
  - Being bagless is a huge environmental advantage at the time, great consideration was also put on the consumer to insure a quality product was provided

* Who was its target audience? What kind of responses did it meet with?
  - "The first prototype vacuum cleaner, a red and blue machine, brought Dyson little success, as he struggled to find a licensee for his machine in the UK and America. Manufacturing companies such as Hoover did not want to licence the design, probably because the vacuum bag market was worth $500m so Dyson was a threat to their profits."[1]

* Can you describe its typical use or experience?
  - Dyson vacuums pride themselves on a powerful, reliable product that will maintain a high level of suction.

* Any other intriguing facts?
  - Producing over 5000 prototypes I found to be very impressive, James Dyson almost went broke multiple times during the 15 years of prototyping. This shows true commitment to the product.

* Do you think it is technically, aesthetically or culturally important or meaningful?
  - Technically this product was revolutionary at the time, aesthetically at the time it was not the most revolutionary, but Dyson has since refined its design aesthetic considerably.  

* In conclusion, why do you think it deserves to be an exemplar of good design?
  - Good design starts with innovative technology, which Dyson achieved. This combined with a the environment and monetary advantages made it a great product. It also meets all of Dieter Rams criteria for good design.

* How would you improve it if you redesign it?
  - Using greater quality materials to give a stronger more premium feel, and minimizing the aesthetic to make it more of an aesthetic statement as apposed to a tool.



#### Maglite Torch
  * Who designed it?
    - Anthony Maglica
  * When was it designed?
    - 1979
  * What did the designer want to express/deliver?
    - Utility, innovative technology, quality products and design
  * How long did it take to complete the design since its inception?
    - Anthony spent 5 years building his company and reputation for quality machined products. Before designing the Maglite
  * What is the material(s) it is made of/from?
    - Glass, anodized aluminum
  * How was it manufactured/crafted?
    - Industrial production site in in Ontario, California

  * How many units have been produced?
    - No exact figures but sales reached $300 million last year so it is not unreasonable to assume hundreds of millions

  * Who was its target audience? What kind of responses did it meet with?
    - Police officers, firefighters and mechanics, it was met with a great response as it is a precision built, high quality product.

  * What are the most impressive qualities or features of the design (in your opinion)?
   - The quality and minimalist design

  * Any other intriguing facts?
    - Anthony's inspiration, a African proverb:  

   "Every morning in Africa, a gazelle awakens. He has only one thought on his mind: To be able to run faster than the fastest lion. If he cannot, then he will be eaten.
    Every morning in Africa a lion awakens. He has only one thought on his mind: To be able to run faster than the slowest gazelle. If he cannot, he will die of hunger.
      Whether you choose to be a gazelle or a lion is of no consequence. It is enough to know that with the rising of the sun, you must run. And you must run faster than you did yesterday or you will die."[3]

  * Do you think it is technically, aesthetically or culturally important or meaningful?
    - Culturally it has become ingrained in jobs associated with utility, such as the target market Police officers, firefighters and mechanics. Police officers have also been known to use them as a substitute for a baton.
  * In conclusion, why do you think it deserves to be an exemplar of good design?
  * How would you improve it if you redesign it?
