#### Selected Issue: Reducing Environmental Impact.
Only 10% of plastics are recycled

36.2 gigatonnes of CO2 are produced yearly and rising

Every year 8 million tons of plastics enter the ocean.

The key issue I have selected is the environmental impact of plastics, as it is one of the worlds greatest issues and I believe with the correct design intervention I could have a hand in mitigating the damages to the environment.  
Although education on the environmental impacts of plastics has improved. The way in which people utilize them has not. My design intervention will aim to change this.  

#### Research: Plastics
- Historical  
  "The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic

- Social   
  Plastics have been a part of culture for over 100 years and due to there low cost and ubiquity are found the majority of consumers products.

- Economic
  Plastics NZ the does not manufacture plastic raw material, has a revenue of $2 billion annually.
