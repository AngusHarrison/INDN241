**According to Dieter Rams, good design:**

* Is innovative
* Makes a product useful
* Is aesthetic
* Makes a product understandable
* Is unobtrusive
* Is honest
* Is long-lasting
* Is thorough down to the last detail
* Is environmentally friendly
* Involves as little design as possible

## Process Step 1
 Select and investigate a series of artefacts referring to multiple sources, such as books, databases, magazines and online information. Some references will be introduced in class, but you are strongly encouraged to search actively articles, design collections, documentaries and encyclopedias for information

Most modern artifacts achieve sustainability by producing quality products that will last.
