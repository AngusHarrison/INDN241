## Good Design

Important aspects of design
* Form
* Function
* Experience
* Culture
* Context
* Sustainability (ecological, economic, political and cultural sustainability)

**Explore and establish a set of design criteria with an emphasis on sustainability and apply it to
compare designed artefacts and identify an exemplar of good design.**

#### Procedure
1. Select and investigate a series of artefacts referring to multiple sources, such as books, databases, magazines and online information. (strongly encouraged to search actively articles, design collections, documentaries and encyclopedias for information.)  

2. Compare the artefacts and narrow them down to a few that you think of as examples of good
design. Start your exploratory analysis by trying to find answers to these questions (where
applicable) for each of the artefacts selected:

* Who designed it?
* When was it designed?
* What did the designer want to express/deliver?
* Was it the designer’s answer or resolution to a problem or issue?
* How long did it take to complete the design since its inception?
* What is the material(s) it is made of/from?
* How was it manufactured/crafted?
* Were there any design/technical challenges? How did the designer overcome them?
* How many units have been produced?
* Was the material(s) and/or manufacturing/crafting process better than its predecessors or
competition? If so, how and why?
* Was there any consideration of its potential impact on the environment, people or society
put into practice ahead of its time?
* Who was its target audience? What kind of responses did it meet with?
* Can you describe its typical use or experience?
* What are the most impressive qualities or features of the design (in your opinion)?
* Did you find any less known but remarkably enticing features?
* Any other intriguing facts?
* Do you think it is technically, aesthetically or culturally important or meaningful?
* In conclusion, why do you think it deserves to be an exemplar of good design?
* How would you improve it if you redesign it?

3. From the analysis, select one artefact that you have identified as an exemplar of good design and
formulate your own design criteria and rationale for your conclusion.  

4. Think about how to communicate your criteria and conclusion in a convincing yet elegant manner
and prepare a visual summary that clearly and succinctly states your criteria and conclusion (A3-
sized)  


* Pay attention to elements of visual communication such as typefaces, colours and arrangement, and
avoid making an excessively wordy poster.

* If you need 3D CAD profiles, check manufacturer’s website, search design communities or make
one by yourself

* When you refer to or reproduce information prepared by someone else, you must indicate
corresponding sources using the APA (American Psychological Association) style. Instructions and
examples can be found at: https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2.html and https://apastyle.apa.org/stylegrammar-guidelines/references/examples
